The Plan:
So my plan was to take the requirments checklist and attempt to go down and tackle each one, one at a time.  Initially at the top of the project I honestly understood very little about how the ajax/jquery interaction worked and how to manipulate them so a big part of going through the steps was a very tedious look through the practice projects for those and try and add each one and test it in the grunt serve environment.  During the process of just the sign in, sign up, change pass, and start game forms I learned a lot about how those interactions worked and what the components of those commands meant such as the url key and data key in the apis which i didn't understand at all at first.  One way I would work through the problems was to console log on both sides of the api to see what the data looked like on both sides and try and work on why those changes were or weren't being made.  In some cases I read through a lot of the jquery documentation and googled some of the key terms to work on my functions.  During the process of getting the gameboard to bo between x and o and not let them be reclicked on I got a lot of help from fellow students in the slack channels and breakout rooms.
